# Churn Modeling for Telco

This project demonstrates how to use the common utilized demo, 
DS for telco, to highlight the experiments and models API features
in Cloudera Data Science Workbench (CDSW).

1.  `train.py` trains a model using Spark for ETL and sklearn for model fitting.
2.  `predict.py` wraps the sklearn model in a simple model function.
3.  `cdsw-build.sh` ensures sklearn is installed for Python 3.
